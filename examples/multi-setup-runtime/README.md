# Multi setup runtime

This examples shows how to use multiple, runtime-parametrised setups.
In this case, we're building on top of the `plain-malloc` example,
generalising to multiple different allocation sizes.

The interface to do so is not yet the most beautiful one
and likely (or hopefully) there will be change in the near future.
